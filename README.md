# Summarise Pacific Herring catch, biological, and abundance data

You will need the [Spawn Index](https://github.com/grinnellm/SpawnIndex) package to calculate the spawn index.
The summary figures and tables generated here are used to make the [Reports](https://github.com/grinnellm/Reports).
The summary data file is used in the Pacfic Herring stock assessment model.
Read the [wiki](https://github.com/grinnellm/DataSummaries/wiki/Getting-started) to get started.
