# Summarise Pacific Herring catch, biological, and abundance data

You will need the [spawn index script](https://github.com/grinnellm/HerringSpawnIndex) to calculate the spawn index.
The summary figures and tables generated here are used to make the [Reports](https://github.com/grinnellm/Reports).
The summary data file is used in the Pacfic Herring stock assessment model.
